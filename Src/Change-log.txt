version 3.0:
Reworked version for release. Main features:
1. Added sort for commands to be executed in the proper order - user can inoput
   commands in any order
2. Added description headers to all routines
3. Added "open" routines for random number and Gauss-quadrature integration
4. Added "default" feature for fission parameters located in
   Data/Fission-Parameters.txt. These are set up on initialization and use a
   format similar to YAHFC commands. They can be overridden by subsequent YAHFC
   commands.

Needs replacements for random number generator and Gauss-quadrature in order to
be released as LLNL wants

version 3.1:

1. New Gauss-quadrature routines based on three-term recurrence relations
   and their eigenvalues.
2. New 64-bit random number generator based on combination of linear
   congruential and Marsaglia xor bit shift operators
3. Fixed sampling errors in pre-equilbrium module
   a. Error in unbiased sampling for pre-equilibrium gammas when cross 
      section is zero
   b. Error in setting angle theta with high-energy emission to a discrete
      state
4. Fixed order of input fission commands to ensure f_lev_ematch is 
   correctly set. The command f_lev_delta has an overide to ensure that
   ematch is above delta. Thus, f_lev_delta needs to be executed first.
5. Put explit intent() for each variable in each function and subroutine
6. Converted file level-density.f to FORTRAN90 and replaced with
   level-density.f90.
7. Added warning when trying to use option "optical_code". No longer used as
   FRESCO is now the only code used with this package.
8. Added warning with option "cs_scale". No longer used and is superceded with 
   the option "cs_unit".
9. Fixed error in KD proton optical potentials in fresco-potentials.f90 

version 3.2

1. All particle types are operational with default optical model potentials. All
   particles can be used as projectiles and ejectiles. By default particles
   d - alpha are excluded as ejectiles and need to be activated with the
   option max_particles. For charged particles the elastic angular distributions
   are given as a ratio with respect to Rutherford scattering.
2. Changed how the optical model is set with the variable particle(k)%opt_pot.
   This is an integer representing one the available optical models for the
   particle k.
3. Decoupled DWBA states in the continuous energy bins from the bin structure.
   It is no longer necessary to rerun fresco if you change the value of de 
   from calculation to calculation.
4. Fixed bug for !-comments placed after valid input. There was a crash if 
   part of the input was optional and used a !-comment.
5. Changed name of file optical_setup.f90 to optical-setup.f90 to make it
   conform to the naming convention used for other files containing
   subroutines.

version 3.3

1. Changed the way emission spectra are printed. They are now in bins centered
   about the printed energy with spacing +/- de/2. At Eout = 0.0, the spectra
   are zero. 
2. Added samples for the elastic channel at the very end of the MC sampling. 
   The elastic events are printed along with all the MC samples with the 
   command dump_events.

version 3.4

1. Fixed error in Legendre expansion for angular distributions from FRESCO. 
   Expanded the angualar distributions for Shape Elastic to 200 points for 
   x=(-1,1).

Version 3.5

1. Completed expansion of angular distribution for all elastic channels, and
   total elastic = Shape + Compound. Added print out of Legendre coefficients.
2. Fixed "elastic" for charged particles. Elastic is printed as a ratio relative
   to Rutherford scattering. Exception: Compound elastic is printed as
   crosssection. The Shape Elastic (from optical model) and total Elastic 
   angular distributions are printed as ratio relative to Rutherford.
2. Improved sampling of emitted angles for primary decays, coupled-channels, 
   DWBA excitations. 
3. Modified angular distributions for inelastic channels. Inelastic scattering
   spectra are collected for each emission energy in 11 bins from x=(-1,1) 
   with dx = 0.2. These are then expanded with a Legendre expansion and 
   angular distributions are reconstructed on a grid with dx = 0.1. The number 
   of Legendre coefficients is based on the actual number of counts in that 
   channel. 
4. Modified angular distributions for all Channels. Inelastic scattering
   spectra are collected for each emission energy in 11 bins from x=(-1,1) 
   with dx = 0.2. These are then expanded with a Legendre expansion and 
   angular distributions are reconstructed on a grid with dx = 0.1. The number 
   of Legendre coefficients is based on the actual number of counts in that 
   channel.
5. Corrected output of level # in the files defining discrete states. The 
   ground state is level # 0.
6. Denoted the target state in output files, inlcuding spin, parity and
   excitation energy.
7. Print more information for properties of final state, whether an inelastic
   reaction, or final state of residual nucleus. State number, spin, parity,
   excitation energy.
8. Fixed print out for charged particles with small cross sections. Note to
   screen when absorption cross section < 1.0d-9 (b), and skipping decay
   process.
9. Added notification to screen during run if width fluctuations are being 
   applied to that incident energy. Also, added notification if width 
   fluctions option is off.
10.Added consistent threshold for minimum cross section threshold.
11.Fixed identification of emitted particles for inelastic reactions to be
   the same as incident particle. Prior it was set up assuming neutrons.

Version 3.6
1. Fixed error in mass of residual printed in Exit Cannel files.
2. Fixed error in "particle" multiplicities in Exit Channel cross section files.

Version 3.7
1. Fixed error in Q-values
2. Added print out of total "Elastic" data for charged particles similar to
   what was implmented for "Shape" (or optical model). For each energy, the
   ratio averaged over cos(theta) is printed. In general, due to the 1(1-x)^2
   factor, the ratio at x=1 is 1 for "shape", and shape >>> compound.
3. Made sure version number was updated in modules.f90

Version 3.8
1. Fixed problem where Elastic_cs.dat wasn't showing up.com

Version 3.9 
1. Added feature to adjust a-parameter when fitting to D0 to provide a similar
   feature as in TALYS. 
2. Made some changes to option names for global and nucleus specfic
   level-density options
3. Adjusted order options are executed and adjusted how default parameters are
   set while setting options and values to improve set up. Also, removed some
   speghetti code that crept in as things were added over time.
4. Fixed what was likely a bug in the boost matrix for cases where initial
   kinetic energy is input with a spread. The boost matrix was setup with the 
   central value and not adjusted for the spread.
5. Fixed typo in output file while describing the vibrational collective
   enhancement factor.

Version 3.10
1. Fixed variable-type mismatch in HF-decay-MC.f90. Corrected L_ang and Max_L
   from integer(kind=8) to integer(kind=4). Potential issue with function poly
2. Fixed some warnings for unitialized variables. They were initialized in
   if statements, so they were "spurious" warnings.

Version 3.11
1. Added consistent options for pre-equilibrium all parameters that can be 
   controlled with inputs, e.g., Rpp, etc
2. Fixed error in well in pre-equilibrium model for incident protons, had same
   value as for incident neutrons.
3. Fixed problem with setting Preeq_V < Preeq_V1, which leads to funny looking
   pre-equilibirum spectrum. Now, if user sets Preeq_V < Preeq_V1, Preeq_V1 =
   Preeq_V - 3. Mostly, a failsafe mode.
4. Reverted back to pure step function in the finite well routine in
   pre-equilibirum model.
5. Added randomness to initial seed if not set with command ran_seed.
   Previously, iseed =  3141592654_int_64. Now, 
   call system_clock(COUNT=cnt,COUNT_RATE=cnt_r,COUNT_MAX=cnt_m) is made 
   to alter the seed at runtime so that iseed = iseed + max(mod(cnt,100000),1). 
   Also, iseed is ensured to be odd. This adds randomness to the start so that 
   successive runs won't be exactly the same. Not used if iseed is set with 
   ran_seed.

Version 3.12
1. Fixed issue with setting up incident energies while calling frescox. Also,
   fixed mixup between relative (COM) and lab frame energies for incdient
   projectiles and calculating and storing transmission coefficients.
